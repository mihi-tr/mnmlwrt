# mnmlwrt - A minimal writer

Lately I discovered the joy of focussed writing using minimal interfaces and editors. Since the selection of minimal writers available on Linux didn't really satisfy me, I thought: this isn't too hard. The design guidelines are: 

* "minimal"
* One file - so install isn't a hassle
* little code
* just the essentials

The 4 essentials of a text editor are: 1) creating new files, 2) editing files, 3) saving files and 4) opening files. This comes down to 4 keyboard shortcuts (you don't want to use the mouse while typing!

* <ctrl-n> New file
* <ctrl-o> Open file
* <ctrl-s> Save file (or save as if no file name is given)
* <ctrl-q> Quit

## Installation

```
pip install git+
```
